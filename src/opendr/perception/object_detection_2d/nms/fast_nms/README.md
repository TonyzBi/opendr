# Fast-NMS Demos

This folder contains minimal code usage examples that showcase the basic functionality of the Fast-NMS implementation 
provided by OpenDR. Specifically the following examples are provided:
1. inference_demo.py: Perform inference on a single image. Setting `--device cpu` performs inference on CPU.

2. eval_demo.py: Perform evaluation on the `PETS` dataset, implemented in OpenDR format.
   Setting `--device cpu` performs evaluation on CPU.
